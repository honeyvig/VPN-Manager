# VPN-Manager
Creating a VPN service similar to Norton VPN, TunnelBear, or Hide.me involves setting up a server that supports various VPN protocols such as WireGuard, OpenVPN, and IKEv2. While it's not feasible to build a fully functional VPN service in a single Python script, I can guide you through creating a basic framework to manage VPN connections with these protocols.

You'd need several components to build a VPN service:

    VPN Server: This is where you configure protocols like WireGuard, OpenVPN, and IKEv2.
    Client Management: This part would handle user configuration files, VPN authentication, and connection establishment.
    Networking Libraries: Python can interact with the underlying OS for network configuration.

Steps for Creating a VPN Service:

    Set up VPN protocols (WireGuard, OpenVPN, IKEv2) on your server.
    Manage client configurations with Python.
    Use Python libraries like subprocess to interact with VPN servers.
    Automate VPN management tasks (e.g., start, stop, and configure VPNs).

Prerequisites:

    You will need a Linux-based server (Ubuntu or Debian is recommended) for the VPN server.
    WireGuard, OpenVPN, and strongSwan (for IKEv2) should be installed on your server.
    The Python script will interact with these tools using subprocess to run system commands.

1. Install VPN Protocols on Server:

    WireGuard:

sudo apt install wireguard

OpenVPN:

sudo apt install openvpn

strongSwan (for IKEv2):

    sudo apt install strongswan

2. Python Script to Manage VPN Connections:

We'll create a Python script that automates the setup and management of VPN connections for the specified protocols (WireGuard, OpenVPN, and IKEv2).
Example Code:

import subprocess
import os
import sys
import time

# Path to configuration files (you would normally have these for your clients)
WIREGUARD_CONFIG_PATH = "/etc/wireguard/wg0.conf"
OPENVPN_CONFIG_PATH = "/etc/openvpn/client.ovpn"
IKEV2_CONFIG_PATH = "/etc/ipsec.conf"  # Assuming you use strongSwan for IKEv2

# Function to start WireGuard VPN
def start_wireguard():
    try:
        print("Starting WireGuard VPN...")
        # Ensure WireGuard config exists
        if os.path.exists(WIREGUARD_CONFIG_PATH):
            # Start WireGuard using wg-quick
            subprocess.run(['sudo', 'wg-quick', 'up', 'wg0'], check=True)
            print("WireGuard VPN started successfully!")
        else:
            print("WireGuard config not found!")
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print(f"Error starting WireGuard VPN: {e}")
        sys.exit(1)

# Function to stop WireGuard VPN
def stop_wireguard():
    try:
        print("Stopping WireGuard VPN...")
        subprocess.run(['sudo', 'wg-quick', 'down', 'wg0'], check=True)
        print("WireGuard VPN stopped successfully!")
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print(f"Error stopping WireGuard VPN: {e}")
        sys.exit(1)

# Function to start OpenVPN
def start_openvpn():
    try:
        print("Starting OpenVPN...")
        # Ensure OpenVPN config exists
        if os.path.exists(OPENVPN_CONFIG_PATH):
            subprocess.run(['sudo', 'openvpn', '--config', OPENVPN_CONFIG_PATH], check=True)
            print("OpenVPN started successfully!")
        else:
            print("OpenVPN config not found!")
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print(f"Error starting OpenVPN: {e}")
        sys.exit(1)

# Function to stop OpenVPN
def stop_openvpn():
    try:
        print("Stopping OpenVPN...")
        subprocess.run(['sudo', 'killall', 'openvpn'], check=True)
        print("OpenVPN stopped successfully!")
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print(f"Error stopping OpenVPN: {e}")
        sys.exit(1)

# Function to start IKEv2 (strongSwan)
def start_ikev2():
    try:
        print("Starting IKEv2 VPN...")
        # Ensure strongSwan is installed and configured
        if os.path.exists(IKEV2_CONFIG_PATH):
            subprocess.run(['sudo', 'ipsec', 'up', 'ikev2'], check=True)
            print("IKEv2 VPN started successfully!")
        else:
            print("IKEv2 config not found!")
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print(f"Error starting IKEv2 VPN: {e}")
        sys.exit(1)

# Function to stop IKEv2 VPN
def stop_ikev2():
    try:
        print("Stopping IKEv2 VPN...")
        subprocess.run(['sudo', 'ipsec', 'down', 'ikev2'], check=True)
        print("IKEv2 VPN stopped successfully!")
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print(f"Error stopping IKEv2 VPN: {e}")
        sys.exit(1)

# Main function to control VPNs
def manage_vpn(protocol, action):
    if protocol == "wireguard":
        if action == "start":
            start_wireguard()
        elif action == "stop":
            stop_wireguard()
        else:
            print("Invalid action for WireGuard VPN")
    
    elif protocol == "openvpn":
        if action == "start":
            start_openvpn()
        elif action == "stop":
            stop_openvpn()
        else:
            print("Invalid action for OpenVPN")
    
    elif protocol == "ikev2":
        if action == "start":
            start_ikev2()
        elif action == "stop":
            stop_ikev2()
        else:
            print("Invalid action for IKEv2")
    else:
        print("Invalid protocol. Choose from 'wireguard', 'openvpn', or 'ikev2'.")

# Command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with the VPN system
if __name__ == "__main__":
    if len(sys.argv) != 3:
        print("Usage: python vpn_manager.py <protocol> <action>")
        print("<protocol> should be one of: 'wireguard', 'openvpn', 'ikev2'")
        print("<action> should be either 'start' or 'stop'")
        sys.exit(1)

    protocol = sys.argv[1].lower()
    action = sys.argv[2].lower()

    manage_vpn(protocol, action)

How This Script Works:

    Manage WireGuard:
        wg-quick is used to bring up and bring down WireGuard interfaces (wg0 in this case).

    Manage OpenVPN:
        OpenVPN configuration files (e.g., client.ovpn) are used with the OpenVPN command-line client to start and stop the VPN connection.

    Manage IKEv2:
        strongSwan is used to manage IKEv2 VPN connections. The script uses the ipsec command to bring up and down the IKEv2 tunnel.

    Command-Line Interface (CLI):
        You can run the script from the terminal with the following commands:

        python vpn_manager.py wireguard start    # Start WireGuard VPN
        python vpn_manager.py wireguard stop     # Stop WireGuard VPN
        python vpn_manager.py openvpn start      # Start OpenVPN
        python vpn_manager.py openvpn stop       # Stop OpenVPN
        python vpn_manager.py ikev2 start        # Start IKEv2 VPN
        python vpn_manager.py ikev2 stop         # Stop IKEv2 VPN

Security Considerations:

    Encryption: Ensure that the VPN configurations for each protocol (WireGuard, OpenVPN, IKEv2) use strong encryption methods. This is crucial for maintaining the privacy and integrity of the data transmitted through the VPN.

    Firewall Configuration: Proper firewall rules should be set up to allow only authorized traffic through the VPN.

    User Authentication: For a production VPN service, you'd need to implement a secure method for user authentication (e.g., certificates for WireGuard and OpenVPN, or username/password for IKEv2).

Conclusion:

This Python script provides a simple framework for managing VPNs using different protocols (WireGuard, OpenVPN, and IKEv2). You can extend this by adding more sophisticated features like logging, automated setup, and security measures.

If you're planning to develop a complete VPN service like TunnelBear or Norton VPN, you would need to invest in network infrastructure, billing systems, security audits, and possibly develop a more sophisticated client application. Let me know if you need help with any part of the project!
